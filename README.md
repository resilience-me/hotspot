# Polar "hot spots" are caused by Birkeland currents

The now accepted theory of sun-Earth Birkeland currents, what astro-physicists call "magnetic ropes" or "flux ropes",<sup>[1]</sup> provides a mechanism to explain polar "hot spots" on planets throughout the solar system. 

CHANDRA x-ray data of Jupiter from 2000,<sup>[2]</sup> the Cassini image of Titan in infrared from 2009,<sup>[3]</sup> and Keck Observatory's temperature data from Saturn in 2004,<sup>[4]</sup> all show increased energy in "hot spots" at the pole. Birkeland currents entering planets through the poles (that power planetary magnetic fields) is a mechanism that fits with the data.

The only other possible explanation is the theory of polar holes, with energy radiating from the planet core.
